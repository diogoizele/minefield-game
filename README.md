# :game_die: Minefield :game_die:


This project has a greater purpose in my learning about git and some concepts of web development + algorithms.

### Project 
 [Check Game](https://diogoizele.github.io/minefield-game/)

#### The Game
The idea is basically to build a minefield game with its main features. The project will challenge me because it carries several concepts that I haven't mastered or learned yet, and so I think it will be fun. at first I will use only:

  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - CSS
 ##

after making this implementation of the basic technologies I will try to migrate the application to a framework, for example React.

##### **let's coding**
